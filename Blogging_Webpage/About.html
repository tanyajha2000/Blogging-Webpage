                   <BR><br>
               <b> Hello and welcome to my beautiful mess of creative madness.</b>
                <br><br>

I am writer, speaker, teacher and adventure seeker. Fueled by my passion for people places and new experience.
I belive that you deserve a life you love.
I belive in the power of storytelling and I believe that what you have to say matters.
People may not remember what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.
So here I am, you can say one another blogger or one more another person who would be sharing her philosophical talks or 
a person who is a believer of uniqueness and want to put her thoughts her observation towards society.
<br><br>
<b>What is the meaning of perception?</b><br>
Perception means the way in which something is regarded, understood, or interpreted. The average person has about 48.6 thoughts per minute, according to the Laboratory of Neuro 
Imaging at the University of Southern California. That adds up to a total of 70,000 thoughts per day. So basically, a lot of thoughts. I badly believe in uniqueness. I feel every 
single human mind have capability to think, to perceive differently. It’s just about how much we think, how much we observe about the tiniest action or to reflect even the minor thoughts 
that cross our mind.
<br><br>
<b>>Why I call it games of perception?</b><br>
Perception is realty. The way you perceive things you become that. So, it’s all the about the game what different mind plays in different human body.
Buddha said “The mind is everything. What you think, you become.” There is truth in this statement. If you can control your mind, you can dictate the course of your life. You can 
either be held captive by your thoughts or set free by them. Whichever one you choose will determine the quality of your life
<br><br>
We have the ability from day one to create an experience that touches at the hearts and minds of the people we connect with.
You are here because you have something to say.
You know you have something valuable to share and you have only barely begun to unleash your reative potential.
As I always say I believe in uniqueness. Lets share our uniqueness.So I woud love to explore unique minds.
<br><br>
So, feel free to contact me. Share me your thoughts, your perceptions. Write me your own thoughts, I would love to read them.
