        <h2>Simplicity: The Backbone Of Life </h2>
        <p>Simplicity: The Backbone Of Life But We Insist On Making It Complex
In today's generation, you may find a wide variety of people who are basically interested in making it complex to have a simple life.
Everyone wants to be known as cool and unique which makes them different from one another but as human beings, he or she is still the same.
 In life, actually being simple can earn you a lot of discipline, manners and even the actual value of time. Usually, people think that backbone 
 of life is just to enjoy it any way you want to but it does not work that way.
<br>
Whenever you do a job or take a quite difficult decision, you need to take it in a simple manner instead of showing off and making 
big mistakes in life. We do not see life in a simple way but we insist on increasing its complexity all the time by adding some problems to it. 
Instead, we can understand the pattern of life that leads us to beautiful paths where we can reach our destination in the much simple way rather
 than choosing the hardest path. Over time, we shall also face the consequence that is being caused due to wrong decisions or hard decisions are 
 taken by us.
 <br>
 <br>

<b>The art of simplicity is puzzle of complexity.</b>
<br>
<br>
Greatness Lies in Simplicity and not Making it Complex
It does not take much amount of energy to be simple in life just like nature. You can see the beauty of nature,
 it is just simple without any complexity but we humans insist on making our life too complex. So, we should not have a thought in our mind 
 that hard paths will usually lead to the beautiful destination. If taking the risk and having stress in life makes you happy then you are not 
 leading a proper life. So try to think in a positive way and always take the simple path as it leads to a beautiful destination achieving your
  entire goal successfully.
  <br><br>

<b>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</b>
<br>
<br>
The word simplicity pertains to being simple and easy, yet simplicity is such a complicated 
thing to find contentment in. When you practice simplicity, you find peace, joy and contentment in the little things
 absent of pretentiousness or being ornate. Simplicity is slowing down and recognizing the beauty in your surroundings, 
 the environment you are in, the smell, sounds, tastes, what you see, feel and who you are with. Simplicity is living a life that is less hectic 
 and shallow. When you understand simplicity, you begin to have an appreciation for things you may not have noticed in the past. 
 The little things in life become the big things because they create some of the biggest joys.
<br>
Life doesn't have to be extravagant to be exciting. Why did you ever stop looking at
 life as an adventure? Yes, you have grown up and have different responsibilities now, but that doesn't mean you can't live simple,
  be silly and still have fun.
When you understand and grasp the beauty in simplicity, you begin to look at it as a way of being, not as a restraint. You no longer
 feel held back, discontent or disappointed by not having the latest and greatest material items. Instead, you find enjoyment and contentment
  in simple things such as a strangers smile, the laughter of a child playing or the smell of the ocean breeze. What you once may have looked
   at as a hindrance or ball and chain becomes a lock and key with something more beautiful than you can imagine behind the door. When you begin 
   to appreciate simplicity, you have the key to the kingdom of serenity and happiness. 
   <br>
Finding contentment in simplicity is often missed because we put emphasis on other things in life. We feel driven or obligated to do or 
accomplish things, to constantly be moving and be productive. We become distracted by technology and focus on selfish desires. We allow these 
things to overload, stress and consume us. It is important to remember to make life less hectic so you can stop and appreciate it.
<br><br>
<b>Create Balance</b><br>
When it comes to simplicity, balance is an important component. It's great to have goals, desires, enjoy new things and to be driven to 
achieve as long as it is done in balance with simplicity. Just as it's important to create balance when it comes to your goals and desires, 
it�s equally important to do this with simplicity. While you should appreciate the simpler things in life, you don�t want to become so complacent 
that you no longer care or feel a desire to maintain yourself. Create balance and find contentment.   
BENEFITS OF SIMPLICITY
When you understand and appreciate simplicity, you find a sense of joy and contentment that can never be taken away from you.
Having an abundance of things requires time and energy to maintain. Simplifying your life by having fewer possessions allows you more time to enjoy what really matters in life.
