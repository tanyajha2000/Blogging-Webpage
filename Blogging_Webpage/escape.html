        <p>No matter how hard we try, we cannot run from oneself.
            <br>
            Your work? Your responsibilities? Your relationships? Your singlehood if you are single? Your deteriorating health? Your poor dietary habits? Your poor exercise regime? Your negative financial status? Your goals? Your aspirations? Your personal issues? Your past?

            Escapism: The tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy.
            Escapism is mental diversion from the thoughts that merely against your actions and typically through activities involving imagination, oversleeping and source of entertainment like social media. Sometimes we don’t even realize that our sudden behavioural change like excess of sleep or doing nothing is because, we are trying to escape from ourselves, we are trying to avoid our own thoughts, we are not ready to accept few things, we are not ready to communicate with oneself and that’s why we are trying to escape.A mind which can see good, which can reflect good and which can process  beautiful thoughts goes dumb. But in all this we just forget that we are running from ourselves and we have start losing ourselves.
            Escapism is a perception, in which we are not ready to accept the change in behaviour of oneself, we are not ready to see our thoughts and actions working in different directions.
            When we try to escape from ourselves, then we start depending on others…we start expecting from others…and obviously expectation hurts. We start reacting over such small things which don’t even matter in life, we start overthinking which kills our understanding… and slowly we start transforming.
            Escapism is not the solution…because one cannot run away from oneself…and we cannot even sit and see oneself changing.
            <br>
            Escapism occurs when you are trying to avoid something. It can Take a good look at your life now. Is there anything that you are trying to avoid dealing with? come in different forms. Some people escape by seeking out alternate activities, such as sleeping and playing. Some drown themselves in work. Some immerse themselves in addiction, like emotional eating (bingeing), smoking, alcohol or even drugs. Some physically run away from their homes. Some may even go as far as to migrate to a new place where they can start “afresh.”

In life, many people try to escape from various things. No matter what they are trying to avoid, these things ultimately ladder down to their fears, their deepest sorrows, their pains, their past, and their disappointments.

In relationships, you see escapism come into play when people rebound after painful breakups. Rather than deal with the situation, they seek solace in someone else. The feeling of being wanted and desired, by someone — anyone — covers up the pain of their breakup. While the person may seem to have escaped dealing with the pain head on, in reality this wound has not been properly addressed nor healed. It is just there, dormant, throbbing silently until the day when it resurfaces in a different manner.
<br>
In other areas of life, you see people escaping from other things. For example, socially shy people who stay away from public spots. People who stay put in passionless jobs because they are afraid of failure from pursuing what they love or because they are afraid to know that there is something far better for them elsewhere. People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of supposed “pain” and “suffering.” People who avoid their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows. People who avoid their issues because they think they have no strength to face them. There are even some who basically spend their whole lives trying to escape from their issues.
<br>
<br>

            <b>So what to do?</b>
            <br>
            Communicate with yourself…Ask yourself what’s affecting you, what is the root cause of your behavioural change…self evaluation is needed rather than sitting and waiting for things to get fine automatically…living a life not being oneself like seriously then what is the worth of living it.
            Take a break and restart.Recollect you energy. As miles to go
            t is important to understand that escapism is a kind of defense mechanism. It occurs as a result of you trying to protect yourself from something. Specifically, your ego trying to protect yourself.

            Except that it really isn’t (protecting you from anything).
            
            It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that avoidance does not solve anything. The proverb ‘Ignorance is bliss’ is probably one of the most delusional proverbs of all time. If there is an issue you are facing with, that issue doesn’t disappear by avoiding it. It’s still there; it will always be there until you face it. It’s like an ostrich burying its head in the sand — just because you turn your head away from everything and pretend that everything is okay, does not mean that it is okay.
            
            Sure, it may seem easy to just avoid your issues. It may seem easy to just sleep everything away and wake up to a bright and sunny morning the next day, with everything faded into a semi-distant memory.
            
            But these don’t solve anything. You may get a temporal sense of relief from not having to face what you are trying to avoid. But who are you really lying to? Seriously, who? You don’t get anything solved from hiding, avoiding, or escaping. You just end up backing off from them all the way until you are eventually walled into a corner one day and you have no choice but to face them.
            
            Until you acknowledge and muster the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear. They will continue to be there, creating looping patterns in your life. You will keep finding yourself stuck in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things, feeling the same emotions, and doing the same things — over, and over, and over again — until the day you finally decide to do something about them. Loops require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.
        <br>
        As long as you are trying to avoid something, a part of you is vibrating at a consciousness level of shame or guilt. So long as a part of you, however small, is trapped at that level, it makes you unable to fully progress and evolve as a person. To grow, you need to confront what you are trying to avoid.

        I’m not saying that facing your issues is easy. It’s not. When you are trying to avoid something, it is usually a reflection of deeper inner issues which you have not resolved. These issues are delicate. These issues are very real. It takes true strength and courage to be able to face them head on.
        
        And in the process of working through your issues, you don’t always win. Sometimes you may make some headway, only to be subdued afterward. Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately. This is especially so if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with since a while back.
        
        But that’s okay. What’s important is you never stop trying. For example, in running Personal Excellence, I witness my course participants and clients facing new blocks every week as they pursue their goals. That’s perfectly normal. Sometimes, they may fall short of the targets they set. They may get discouraged and dismayed. But in the coaching process, they eventually regather themselves and continue to press on and fight. They stay receptive to external help as they move forward. And because they keep going at it, they eventually succeed in the end.
        
        As long as you keep going; as long as you keep confronting your issues; as long as you keep fighting, you *will* become stronger and stronger. You will grow bigger than your problems such that they are no longer problems. You will level up. If you need additional ammo, join support groups or get a good coach with a proven track record to battle these issues together. I promise you that it will simply be a matter of time before you emerge victorious.
        
        When that happens, you will be living a life where you are truly liberated; a life where you are no longer running or hiding from something. A life of courage and bravery. A life of truth, authenticity and honesty to everyone. A life of integrity and honesty to yourself.
