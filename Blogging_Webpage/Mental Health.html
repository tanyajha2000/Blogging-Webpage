            <b> Today is World mental health day: </b>
            
World Mental Health Day is observed on 10 October every year, with the overall objective of raising awareness of mental health issues around the 
world and mobilizing efforts in support of mental health.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence 
through adulthood.

Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. 
Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:

Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
Family history of mental health problems
<br><br>
The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness.

They also emphasize that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as well as throughout different communities and societies the world over.

In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimate that almost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year.

In 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adults in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a severe psychological condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
<br> <br>
The society we live in, is afraid of accepting mental illness. ILLNESSES exactly my point. What u will do if u get to know u are suffering from cancer?? Ofcourse Everyone will try to get best treatments done, but why?? 
just because its a fatal disease and there is a chance of losing life. I question…what is worth of life if we don’t not have  peaceful and sound 
mind…The way we are concerned about other illnesses…the way we run to 1000 of doctors, medicine and  therapies for our treatments…Then why not for
 mental illness?? Infact in most of the cases it is self cured…you don’t need costly treatment to cure this…just a bit self awareness of your body
  and mind…specially to understand and accept that yes you are suffering from mental illness…You are the parent of your own body…and parenting is 
  the most difficult job.<br><br>
Take out time to analyze yourself.<br>
Listen to what your brain and heart say.<br>
Learn to balance them.<br>
Read books.<br>
Listen to good music.<br>
Talk to your family and friends.<br>

Think before you trust and expect.<br>
Indulge yourself in reading and writing.<br>
Involve in things you love, like your hobbies.<br>
Learn to share your joy and sorrow, sharing brings happiness.<br>
Learn to Express emotions, either it is happiness or anger.<br>
Never loose trust on the Divine power.<br>
Move with the flow, don’t stuck your self in one situation.<br>
And many more<br><br>
And even then if you feel you are not able to cure yourself, its absolutely fine…take your time…meet mentors , counselors and doctors…there is no shame in this…what the society will think should not stop you, your mental health should be your priority.
<br>
<br>Ya saying all this is so easy, to apply is hard. But we should, and we have to, not for anyone but for ourselves
